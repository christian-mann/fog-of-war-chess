README

Fog of War Chess is a version of chess with the following restriction: A player may only see those spaces to which he could, on the next turn, conceivably move one of his pieces.
There is one exception: Pawns can see the three squares immediately in front of them.

This implementation is network-enabled. To play, have one player run the program and select "Server".
Then have the second player run the program, select "Client", and put the IP address of the server in the dialog box.

This implementation will not tell you when you are checkmated. However, you will not be allowed to violate the rules of chess (i.e. placing your king in check, etc).
